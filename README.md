# GraphQL
## About
* This project is done to present some statistics about 01-edu program's students, feel free to use any of the code for your own endeavours.

## Running the program
* Use command `cd` to move to desired location in your system.
* Use command `git clone https://01.kood.tech/git/liki123/GraphQL` to clone the repository to previously chosen location.
* Use the `cd GraphQL` command once again to enter the downloaded (now: local) repository. <br>
**_NOTE:_** `I used VS Code extension to run the code, in case you use some other IDE and you are not sure how to replicate the behaviour, then you may aswell use my hosted page for testing the application.`<br>`<linkSoonToBeAdded>`<br>
* Search for `Live Server` extension by `Ritwick Dey` and install it. (You may need to close and restart your IDE in order for the extension to start working)
* Now a `Go live` button should have appeared in bottom right corner of the VS Code window. Click on it and the server should start and the page should pop-open in your default browser.<br>
**_NOTE:_** `To close the server, press the same button once again or close the IDE.`<br>
